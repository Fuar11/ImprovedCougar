# Improved Cougar

Improved Cougar is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

Improved Cougar adds and changes certain mechanics surrounding the Cougar. 

## Territory

In vanilla, aggravating the cougar by shooting at it or simply being attacked by it will cause it's territory to expand. If you survive the encounter you will find the cougar elsewhere in the region. 
However killing the cougar does not result in the territory receding and thus you can encounter additional cougars in the region as a result of your actions. I find this makes no sense so this mod changes that.

Whenever you engage a cougar in it's territory, it's territory will expand as you'd expect. 
However when you kill the cougar, anywhere in the region, it's territory will recede and it will take the standard respawn time for you to encounter the cougar in the world again.

## Cougar Health & Speed

In the Mod Settings menu you have the option to tune the Cougar's max health and attack speed. 
Default values are lower for the max health to make it easier to kill but higher for the speed to make it harder to catch when it attacks.

## Map Settings

In vanilla, when the cougar appears in the world the 1st territory will be automatically shown on the map for every region that has them. Both the icon and a small survey of the area. 
When more territory opens up the same icon appears on the map in a new spot. This is immersion breaking and defeats the purpose of environmental signs. You will now have the option to exclude the icon and the survey for new territories.
